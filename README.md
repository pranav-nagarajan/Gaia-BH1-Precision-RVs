# ESPRESSO Observations of Gaia BH1
This repository serves as a companion to the publication "ESPRESSO Observations of Gaia BH1: high-precision orbital constraints and no evidence for an inner binary" ([Nagarajan et al. 2024](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1538-3873/ad1ba7)). In this repository, we provide both the ESPRESSO spectra used to measure the precision radial velocities and a Jupyter Notebook to reproduce relevant plots from the associated paper.
