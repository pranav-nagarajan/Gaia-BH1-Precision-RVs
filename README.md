# ESPRESSO Observations of Gaia BH1
This repository serves as a companion to the forthcoming publication "ESPRESSO Observations of Gaia BH1: high-precision orbital constraints and no evidence for an inner binary" (Nagarajan et al. 2023). In this repository, we provide both the ESPRESSO spectra used to measure the precision radial velocities and a Jupyter Notebook to reproduce relevant plots from the associated paper.
